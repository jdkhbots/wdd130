            <p>Hello, I am John Derek Kakraba Hagan. But you can call me JDK Hagan. I currently live in Kumasi, Ghana. I love to learn new things, and that is why I am taking this course. I hope to become a robotics engineer in the future.</p>

            <p>Ghana is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Togo, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and the Gulf of Guinea. It is a beautiful land which was initially called the Gold Coast. This name was given because gold existed bountifully on the country before and during their colonisation.</p>
