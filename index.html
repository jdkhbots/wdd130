            <p>Hello, I am John Derek Kakraba Hagan. But you can call me JDK Hagan. I am from Assin Foso in the Central Region of Ghana but I currently live in Kumasi, in the Ashanti Region. I am the last and only male child with two other siblings. I love my family so much. I want to be able to provide all their needs someday. I love to learn new things, and that is why I am taking this course. I hope to become a robotics engineer in the future.<br> I know things don't always go as planned, but I know that all things will work out for my good. I believe so.</p>

            <p>Ghana is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Togo, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and the Gulf of Guinea. It is a beautiful land which was initially called the Gold Coast. This name was given because gold existed bountifully on the country before and during their colonisation.</p>
